    "bio": "Idiosyncratic pop singer Ed Sheeran borrows from any style that crosses his path, molding genres to fit a musical character all his own that's charming, personable, and popular on a global scale. Elements of folk, hip-hop, pop, dance, soul, and rock can be heard in his big hits \"The A Team,\" \"Sing,\" \"Thinking Out Loud,\" and \"Shape of You\" -- which gives him a broad appeal among different demographics. It also helped elevate him to international acclaim not long after the release of his 2011 debut LP, +, and took 2014's x and 2017's ÷ to the top of both the U.K. albums chart and the Billboard 200. Sheeran maintained his stardom with savvy collaborations -- his 2019 album No. 6 Collaborations Project featured an eclectic roster including , , , , , and  -- and by continuing to write candidly about his life: his 2021 album = was filled with songs about being a new father. Sheeran's musical explorations continued on -, a 2023 album that featured several tracks co-written and co-produced by  of , and its swiftly released companion, Autumn Variations, both of which reached the Top Five in the U.K. and on the Billboard 200.\n\nWhen Ed Sheeran released +, he had just turned 20. He had been playing music since he was a child in Framlingham, Suffolk -- he was born in Halifax, West Yorkshire but his family moved when he was young -- enthralled by the classic rock he heard around the house. Sheeran started writing music in his early teens, recording a self-made album called Spinning Man when he was 13 in 2004. In addition to making music at home -- he put out an EP titled The Orange Room in 2005 -- he'd busk on the streets and play whatever stage he could find. When he was 16, he dropped out of school and moved to London so he could make a go of a professional career, landing work as a guitar tech for Nizlopi, gigging whenever he could, and auditioning unsuccessfully for the ITV series Britannia High. The self-released EP You Need Me arrived in 2009 -- it followed 2006's eponymous EP and 2007's Want Some? -- but his momentum started to build in 2010 thanks to the EPs Loose Change and Songs I Wrote with Amy and, especially, performance videos he posted to YouTube. Sheeran started to generate considerable buzz --  invited him to appear on his Sirius/XM radio show -- and he landed a deal with  in late 2010. After a final independent EP, No. 5 Collaborations, arrived in January 2011, he signed a contract with 's management team.\n\nAll of this laid the groundwork for a busy 2011. Sheeran entered the studio with  to record his major-label debut. Its first single, \"The A Team,\" arrived in June 2011, entering the charts at number three. August brought \"You Need Me, I Don't Need You,\" setting the stage for the September release of +. Assisted by the success of November's single \"Lego House,\" the record became a huge hit in the U.K., a fact underscored by his win of British Breakthrough in the 2012 Brit Awards. Sheeran's success soon spread to Australia, Europe, Canada, and then the United States. He received a boost in the U.S. by opening for  in 2012, but that paled in comparison to the exposure he received opening for  on her Red tour in 2013. His endorsement from , combined with his landing of the closing credits song \"I See Fire\" for The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, set Sheeran up for an eventful 2014.\n\nAlong with reuniting with , Sheeran worked with  and  for X, the sophomore set that arrived in June 2014. X debuted at number one on both sides of the Atlantic and generated the huge hits \"Thinking Out Loud\" and \"Sing,\" success that helped Sheeran secure a win for Album of the Year in the 2015 Brit Awards, along with the trophy for Best Male Solo Artist. His success wasn't limited to Britain. X was the second biggest-selling album in the world in 2015, coming in behind 's 25, and \"Thinking Out Loud\" took home the Grammys for Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance in 2016.\n\nSheeran spent the majority of 2016 recuperating and recording his third album with executive producer . Early in 2017, he released two singles, \"Castle on the Hill\" and \"Shape of You,\" with the latter reaching number one on the charts throughout the world. Their parent album, ÷, appeared in March. ÷ topped the pop charts in over 20 territories, including the U.K. and U.S., and it generated another international hit in \"Galway Girl.\" Ed Sheeran's massive popularity was confirmed in June 2017, when he was awarded an MBE on the occasion of the Queen's Birthday Honours. Over the next year, Sheeran stayed busy touring. He also picked up several more accolades including winning the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album for ÷ and Best Pop Solo Performance for \"Shape of You.\"\n\nIn 2019, he paired with  for the single \"I Don't Care.\" It was the first of a series of duets which Sheeran collected on No. 6 Collaborations Project. The album appeared on July 12, 2019 and topped numerous charts just a few weeks after the release of Yesterday, a Danny Boyle film set in an alternate world where  never existed that featured Sheeran in a pivotal role. No. 6 Collaborations Project went on to be nominated for a Grammy in the Best Pop Vocal Album category. In December 2020, Sheeran offered up the acoustic non-album single, \"Afterglow\" as a Christmas gift to his fans.\n\nSheeran returned with \"Bad Habits\" in June 2021; the single topped the charts in nearly every country, save the U.S., where it peaked at two. The track was the first single from his fifth album, =. Arriving in October 2021, the record found Sheeran grappling with fatherhood and featured songwriting collaborations from , , and , among others. It continued Sheeran's streak of number one albums in the U.K. and was equally successful internationally. That December, he joined  for the holiday song \"Merry Christmas,\" which topped the U.K. singles chart and Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart. The single was also included on a Christmas edition of =, as well as 's The Lockdown Sessions. Sheeran then collaborated with Colombian singer  on 2021's \"Sigue\" and 2022's \"Forever My Love.\" Also in 2022, he scored a Top Ten U.K. hit with the Pokémon-related \"Celestial\" before kicking off 2023 with \"F64,\" a heartfelt tribute to the late British music entrepreneur Jamal Edwards.\n\nSheeran launched the cycle for his fifth album in early 2023 with the release of the singles \"Eyes Closed\" and \"Boat.\" Both songs were included on -, a record that featured several collaborations with  of , along with work by , Shellback, and . Four months afterward - debuted at number one in the U.K. and number two in the U.S. Sheeran released Autumn Variations, an album recorded with  as producer. The latter album also topped the charts in the U.K. and reached the Top Ten of the Billboard 200. By the end of the year, - had earned a Best Pop Vocal Album nomination at the 66th Grammy Awards. The singer's first-ever greatest-hits album, +-=÷× TOUR COLLECTION, arrived in September 2024 and combined live recordings with some of his most beloved studio hits. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi",

Recently she returned with a collaboration with viral music star Dean Lewis, releasing the hauntingly beautiful song “28”.\n\nAfter her debut song “Lost Boy,” which was an instant viral global chart-topping hit in 2015 that propelled her debut EP The Intro into a gold-certification, she released two more critically acclaimed full projects that earned her three Juno nominations, including Album of the Year and Artist of the Year. In 2022, Ruth B.’s beautiful composition “Paper Airplanes,” was used as the end title song for Tyler Perry’s feature film A Jazzman’s Blues. To follow it all up came “Jupiter Rising” from R&B young superstar Rod Wave, who used Ruth’s recent song, “Paper Airplanes”, as the musical bed for his R&B hit single.\n\nThis year brought more hits with “Always You”, the theme song from the major motion picture Maybe I Do, to the young singer Lyn Lapid’s hot new Republic Records track “Do You Really” composed by and featuring Ruth B. on vocals.\n\nBoth Ruth B. and Dean Lewis are members of the 4 billion streams club, and their collaboration on “28” is just a signal of more to come from Ruth B.\n\nPosted By Ruth B.",

    "bio": "Maroon 5 -- and, specifically, its frontman  -- became the face of blue-eyed soul in the 21st century, managing to navigate shifting trends in music and fashion to be one of the biggest pop bands of their generation. They took the long way to the top, evolving from the straight-ahead '90s rock band  into the sleek, soulful Maroon 5 with 2002's Songs About Jane, an album that languished for two years until \"This Love\" climbed to number five on Billboard's Hot 100 in 2004. From that point forward, the group was a fixture at the top of the charts, their popularity receiving a considerable and enduring boost when  was cast as a judge on NBC's televised talent competition The Voice in 2011. That year, their  duet \"Moves Like Jagger\" gave Maroon 5 their second number one -- \"Makes Me Wonder\" went to the top in 2007 -- and kicked off a string of Top Ten hits highlighted by the number ones \"One More Night\" and \"Girls Like You,\" a run that helped secure the band a headlining Super Bowl gig in 2019. \"Girls Like You\" featured an appearance by , a sign of how Maroon 5 kept current by embracing modern R&B and hip-hop. The band followed this blueprint by enlisting  for \"Beautiful Mistakes,\" a lead single from 2021's Jordi, as well as the 2021  remix of \"One Light\" and the 2023 single \"Middle Ground.\"\n\nPrior to Maroon 5, bandmates  (vocals/guitar), Jesse Carmichael (keyboards), Mickey Madden (bass), and Ryan Dusick (drums) had spent the latter half of the '90s playing in , even releasing a debut album for  while still attending high school. The record tanked, however, and  found themselves dropped from 's roster. After briefly attending college, the bandmates regrouped as Maroon 5, adding former  guitarist James Valentine to the lineup and embracing a more R&B-influenced sound. Several years later, the quintet had officially risen to the forefront of pop music with Songs About Jane and It Won't Be Soon Before Long, both of which went multi-platinum.\n\nSongs About Jane propelled the band into the mainstream, but the album was not an immediate hit.  had signed the newly christened Maroon 5 in 2001, and the debut album Jane received a lukewarm response upon its release in June 2002. \"Harder to Breathe\" became a radio staple 17 months later and was soon followed by the omnipresent \"This Love,\" whose steamy video (featuring frontman  and a barely clothed girlfriend) wooed the TV-watching crowds at MTV. Songs About Jane finally entered the Billboard Top Ten in August 2004, more than two years after the album's release, and follow-up singles like \"She Will Be Loved\" and \"Sunday Morning\" helped the album move over 2.7 million copies by year's end.\n\nMaroon 5 toured exhaustively in support of Jane's slow-burning success, issuing two stopgap recordings -- 2004's 1.22.03.Acoustic and 2005's Live Friday the 13th -- while traveling the world alongside the likes of  and . Their schedule was especially trying on percussionist Dusick, who sustained wrist and shoulder injuries and was often unable to play. By fall 2006, Dusick had been officially replaced by Matt Flynn (the former drummer for ), and the revised band released its sophomore effort in May 2007. It Won't Be Soon Before Long proved to be less popular than its predecessor (which had sold more than four million copies in the U.S. alone), but it still enjoyed double-platinum certification while spinning off the chart-topping single \"Makes Me Wonder.\" Maroon 5 had cemented their status as pop/rock heavyweights, and they now had the connections to prove it. Released in late 2008, Call and Response: The Remix Album reinterpreted the band's catalog with remixes by influential producers like , , and .\n\nBetween 2008 and 2010, the band worked with a different producer -- veteran rock/country architect  -- on a third studio album, Hands All Over, which was released in September 2010. Although it was kept from the top of the album charts, it went platinum. Also, the following year, it received a big boost when  began appearing as a judge on the NBC reality television talent competition The Voice. That same year, Hands All Over was re-released with the single \"Moves Like Jagger,\" featuring 's The Voice co-judge ; the single promptly hit the top of the charts. In 2012, Carmichael revealed that he was taking time off from performing with Maroon 5 and would be replaced by touring keyboardist .\n\nIn April 2012, the band teased the release of its fourth studio album with \"Payphone,\" a single featuring  that hit number two. The resulting album, Overexposed, also reached number two, featuring production from a bevy of name producers including , , , and more. A second single from the album, the reggae-tinged \"One More Night,\" topped the charts not long after its release in June, and stayed at the top long enough to become the band's most successful showing to date. Two further singles also reached the Top Ten, \"Daylight\" and \"Love Somebody.\"\n\nDuring 2013,  continued to appear on The Voice, and also made appearances in the television drama American Horror Story, as well as the music-based dramatic film Begin Again. The band also hit the studio to record songs for a fifth studio album, aptly titled V, which saw keyboardist Jesse Carmichael return to the fold after a brief hiatus. Released in September 2014, V debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart and produced several Top Ten singles including \"Maps,\" \"Animals,\" and \"Sugar.\" Two more singles followed in 2015 with \"This Summer's Gonna Hurt Like a Motherf*****\" and \"Feelings.\" Also in 2015, Maroon 5 released their first hits collection, The Singles.\n\nThe single \"Don't Wanna Know,\" featuring rapper , appeared in 2016 and peaked at number nine on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It was later revealed to be the first single from their forthcoming sixth LP. A second collaborative single, \"Cold,\" featuring , was released in early 2017, with \"What Lovers Do\" appearing before the November release of Red Pill Blues. A reference to the choice of taking either red or blue pills first presented in the 1999 sci-fi film The Matrix, Red Pill Blues also featured guest appearances by , , ASAP Rocky, and . It peaked at number two on the Billboard 200. In 2018, the band issued a remix of the album track \"Girls You Like,\" featuring an appearance by , which wound up being their first single to reach number one on the Billboard charts since 2012's \"One More Night.\"\n\nOn February 3, 2019, Maroon 5 headlined the Super Bowl LIII halftime show in Atlanta, Georgia, supported by rappers  and . That September, they released \"Memories\" as the lead-single off their seventh studio-album, Jordi. Both the song and the album title were dedicated to the band's late manager, Jordan Feldstein who died in December 2017 from pulmonary embolism. In 2020, bassist Mickey Madden announced he was retiring from the group following an arrest for domestic violence allegations. The band carried on with the topical single \"Nobody's Love,\" which was partly inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic and racial protests following the murder of George Floyd. They also teamed up with  for the 2021 single \"Beautiful Mistakes.\" All of this led up to the release of Jordi, which arrived in June 2021, peaking at number 8 on the Billboard 200. A fourth single, \"Lost,\" appeared soon after, charting at 27 on the Pop 100. More tracks followed, including a 2022 remix of \"One Light\" by , featuring  and , and 2023's \"Middle Ground,\" the latter of which found the band working with producers , , and Pete Nappi. ~ Andrew Leahey, Rovi",

    "bio": "Multi-platinum selling, GRAMMY® and Golden Globe nominated recording artist Wiz Khalifa burst onto the scene with the release of his first major label debut album, ROLLING PAPERS‎ in 2011. ‎ROLLING PAPERS spawned the hugely successful hits “Black and Yellow,” “Roll Up,” and “No Sleep” and gave Wiz the platform to win the award for “Best New Artist” at the 2011 BET Awards and “Top New Artist” at the 2012 Billboard Music Awards. “Black and Yellow” also earned him his first two GRAMMY nods for “Best Rap Performance” and “Best Rap Song”. As a follow up to ROLLING PAPERS, Wiz Released O.N.I.F.C. in 2012. This album featured tracks “Work Hard, Play Hard” and “Remember You” featuring The Weeknd. His third studio album released in 2014, BLACC HOLLYWOOD, ‎debuted at #1 on Billboard’s Top 200 album chart and included the hit single \"We DemBoyz.\" Soon after, Wiz’s track,‎ “See You Again,” off the FURIOUS 7 soundtrack, catapulted to the top of the charts across 95 countries and earned him a Golden Globes nomination for “Best Original Song”. Wiz released his album, KHALIFA, in February 2016 as a thank you to fans which included the tracks “Bake Sale” featuring Travis Scott and “Elevated.” Wiz released his project, The Saga of Wiz Khalifa, which was followed by his critically acclaimed collaborative album, FULL COURT PRESS, with Girl Talk, Big K.R.I.T., and Smoke DZA. In July 2022, Wiz released MULTIVERSE, to rave reviews. His newest album, KUSH + ORANGE JUICE 2 is out now.\n\nPosted By Wiz Khalifa",

    "bio": "Idiosyncratic pop singer Ed Sheeran borrows from any style that crosses his path, molding genres to fit a musical character all his own that's charming, personable, and popular on a global scale. Elements of folk, hip-hop, pop, dance, soul, and rock can be heard in his big hits \"The A Team,\" \"Sing,\" \"Thinking Out Loud,\" and \"Shape of You\" -- which gives him a broad appeal among different demographics. It also helped elevate him to international acclaim not long after the release of his 2011 debut LP, +, and took 2014's x and 2017's ÷ to the top of both the U.K. albums chart and the Billboard 200. Sheeran maintained his stardom with savvy collaborations -- his 2019 album No. 6 Collaborations Project featured an eclectic roster including , , , , , and  -- and by continuing to write candidly about his life: his 2021 album = was filled with songs about being a new father. Sheeran's musical explorations continued on -, a 2023 album that featured several tracks co-written and co-produced by  of , and its swiftly released companion, Autumn Variations, both of which reached the Top Five in the U.K. and on the Billboard 200.\n\nWhen Ed Sheeran released +, he had just turned 20. He had been playing music since he was a child in Framlingham, Suffolk -- he was born in Halifax, West Yorkshire but his family moved when he was young -- enthralled by the classic rock he heard around the house. Sheeran started writing music in his early teens, recording a self-made album called Spinning Man when he was 13 in 2004. In addition to making music at home -- he put out an EP titled The Orange Room in 2005 -- he'd busk on the streets and play whatever stage he could find. When he was 16, he dropped out of school and moved to London so he could make a go of a professional career, landing work as a guitar tech for Nizlopi, gigging whenever he could, and auditioning unsuccessfully for the ITV series Britannia High. The self-released EP You Need Me arrived in 2009 -- it followed 2006's eponymous EP and 2007's Want Some? -- but his momentum started to build in 2010 thanks to the EPs Loose Change and Songs I Wrote with Amy and, especially, performance videos he posted to YouTube. Sheeran started to generate considerable buzz --  invited him to appear on his Sirius/XM radio show -- and he landed a deal with  in late 2010. After a final independent EP, No. 5 Collaborations, arrived in January 2011, he signed a contract with 's management team.\n\nAll of this laid the groundwork for a busy 2011. Sheeran entered the studio with  to record his major-label debut. Its first single, \"The A Team,\" arrived in June 2011, entering the charts at number three. August brought \"You Need Me, I Don't Need You,\" setting the stage for the September release of +. Assisted by the success of November's single \"Lego House,\" the record became a huge hit in the U.K., a fact underscored by his win of British Breakthrough in the 2012 Brit Awards. Sheeran's success soon spread to Australia, Europe, Canada, and then the United States. He received a boost in the U.S. by opening for  in 2012, but that paled in comparison to the exposure he received opening for  on her Red tour in 2013. His endorsement from , combined with his landing of the closing credits song \"I See Fire\" for The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, set Sheeran up for an eventful 2014.\n\nAlong with reuniting with , Sheeran worked with  and  for X, the sophomore set that arrived in June 2014. X debuted at number one on both sides of the Atlantic and generated the huge hits \"Thinking Out Loud\" and \"Sing,\" success that helped Sheeran secure a win for Album of the Year in the 2015 Brit Awards, along with the trophy for Best Male Solo Artist. His success wasn't limited to Britain. X was the second biggest-selling album in the world in 2015, coming in behind 's 25, and \"Thinking Out Loud\" took home the Grammys for Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance in 2016.\n\nSheeran spent the majority of 2016 recuperating and recording his third album with executive producer . Early in 2017, he released two singles, \"Castle on the Hill\" and \"Shape of You,\" with the latter reaching number one on the charts throughout the world. Their parent album, ÷, appeared in March. ÷ topped the pop charts in over 20 territories, including the U.K. and U.S., and it generated another international hit in \"Galway Girl.\" Ed Sheeran's massive popularity was confirmed in June 2017, when he was awarded an MBE on the occasion of the Queen's Birthday Honours. Over the next year, Sheeran stayed busy touring. He also picked up several more accolades including winning the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album for ÷ and Best Pop Solo Performance for \"Shape of You.\"\n\nIn 2019, he paired with  for the single \"I Don't Care.\" It was the first of a series of duets which Sheeran collected on No. 6 Collaborations Project. The album appeared on July 12, 2019 and topped numerous charts just a few weeks after the release of Yesterday, a Danny Boyle film set in an alternate world where  never existed that featured Sheeran in a pivotal role. No. 6 Collaborations Project went on to be nominated for a Grammy in the Best Pop Vocal Album category. In December 2020, Sheeran offered up the acoustic non-album single, \"Afterglow\" as a Christmas gift to his fans.\n\nSheeran returned with \"Bad Habits\" in June 2021; the single topped the charts in nearly every country, save the U.S., where it peaked at two. The track was the first single from his fifth album, =. Arriving in October 2021, the record found Sheeran grappling with fatherhood and featured songwriting collaborations from , , and , among others. It continued Sheeran's streak of number one albums in the U.K. and was equally successful internationally. That December, he joined  for the holiday song \"Merry Christmas,\" which topped the U.K. singles chart and Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart. The single was also included on a Christmas edition of =, as well as 's The Lockdown Sessions. Sheeran then collaborated with Colombian singer  on 2021's \"Sigue\" and 2022's \"Forever My Love.\" Also in 2022, he scored a Top Ten U.K. hit with the Pokémon-related \"Celestial\" before kicking off 2023 with \"F64,\" a heartfelt tribute to the late British music entrepreneur Jamal Edwards.\n\nSheeran launched the cycle for his fifth album in early 2023 with the release of the singles \"Eyes Closed\" and \"Boat.\" Both songs were included on -, a record that featured several collaborations with  of , along with work by , Shellback, and . Four months afterward - debuted at number one in the U.K. and number two in the U.S. Sheeran released Autumn Variations, an album recorded with  as producer. The latter album also topped the charts in the U.K. and reached the Top Ten of the Billboard 200. By the end of the year, - had earned a Best Pop Vocal Album nomination at the 66th Grammy Awards. The singer's first-ever greatest-hits album, +-=÷× TOUR COLLECTION, arrived in September 2024 and combined live recordings with some of his most beloved studio hits. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi",

    "bio": "In September 2013, when Irish solo artist Andrew Hozier-Byrne released his debut single - a song called ‘Take Me To Church’ - which he had mostly recorded in the attic of his parent’s house in Wicklow (his father a blues musician, his mother an artist), little did he know about the hurricane-strength surge in public interest that the song would spark, carrying him to international stardom.\n\n10 years and billions of streams later, Hozier still calls Wicklow home. While his music takes him all over the world, it is Ireland, its people and places, the weather and landscape that calls him back to where he feels he naturally belongs.\n\nThe much anticipated follow up to Hozier’s debut album, ‘Wasteland, Baby!’ was released to massive critical acclaim in 2019, entering the Billboard Top 200 Chart at #1. 2023 was a big year for Hozier, as his debut single Take Me To Church was the 30th song ever to reach 1 billion streams. He released his third album ‘Unreal Unearth’, which charted #1 in the UK, Ireland, and Top 5 in the US, Netherlands, Germany & New Zealand.\n\nThe last decade has brought both public and critical acclaim. Multi-platinum album sales, number one records, multiple awards including a Grammy-nomination, film and video game soundtracks and countless sold-out live shows all over the world. But as Hozier prepares for 2024, his passion for his art is undimmed, and his curiosity about our world - and all that is good and bad about it - remains undiminished.\n\nPosted By Hozier",

    "bio": "GRAMMY-nominated & multi-platinum singer/songwriter Shawn Mendes has released 4 acclaimed studio albums, with his 5th studio album Shawn out now. The new album draws deeply from his travels and experiences over the last few years, following the cancellation of his 2022 tour. Representing his most musically intimate and lyrically honest work to date, Shawn guides listeners through a profound self-dialogue with each song. In 2018 Shawn released his self-titled platinum album, which was also nominated in two categories for the 61st annual GRAMMY® Awards, including “Song of the Year” for “In My Blood” and “Best Pop Vocal Album” for SHAWN MENDES. The same year Shawn debuted his 3x platinum single, “If I Can’t Have You.” Following the GRAMMY nominated album, Shawn’s 2020 album, Wonder, debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, becoming Shawn's fourth consecutive US number-one album (the youngest male artist to achieve that feat at the time). In 2019, Shawn was nominated for a GRAMMY for “Best Pop Duo/Group Performance” for “Señorita,” his hit single with Camila Cabello. With “Señorita” at #1 and “If I Can’t Have You” at #2, Shawn is the first male solo artist ever to simultaneously hold the #1 and #2 places on the Top 40 chart. Shawn broke onto the scene in April of 2017 with his 6x platinum hit “There’s Nothing Holdin’ Me Back.” The track scored Shawn his second #1 single at Top 40 radio and on Billboard’s Pop Songs chart, joining his 8x platinum single “Stitches.”\n\nPosted By Shawn Mendes",
